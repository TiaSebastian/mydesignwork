            <p>Chime In & Reflect with Me (2025)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-text"> 
            <P>This project was realised during my BA Design Course “Object As Architecture” (UNSW). The brief required us to research an architect that we were interested in and iterate and utilise metal-making skills to come to an end object. 
                <br>
                <br>My process was inspired by the works of Pakistani architect Yasmeen Lari. Through research I resonated with Yasmeen’s aproach on decolonising her view on design and going back to her roots. As a woman of colour, her approach to design was inspiring to me and allowed for this to influence my concept. This piece was a means to get familiar with metalwork again and to also consider how an object can evoke a sense of stillness and reflection when thinking about where we come from. My works always tend to bring me back to reflection on family ties and culture, and through elements of the chimes I explored the idea of my connection the strong Filipino lineage of women that I come from.

            <P>This project came to life during my BA Design Course “Object One”. This was my first introduction in to ceramic and metalwork. The brief required us to create three ceramic pieces and three jewellery pieces.
                <br>
                <br>My approach with creating these pieces and concept came through making as practice. Being my first object design project, I naturally fell into the concept of exploring how objects can represent generations within my family. Again, exploring the lineage of women that I come from.

            <P>This was my textiles project that was based on Llama fibres. The brief of the assessment was to make a collection with two various techniques we had learnt throughout our course, based on an assigned fibre. 
                <br>
                <br>Coiling, weaving and natural dyeing was introduced to us during this subject. Being given a fibre to explore was super interesting to me as it was so niche, but allowed me to really take into consideration texture, colour palette and how much something can drive your concept.
                    This basket was one out of four textiles samples. I had so much fun with the coiling process that I decided to let myself make a 3D object as opposed to a 2D textiles sample.
